# AI Music: Palestrina Bot
## Fall 2016 Independent Work

Through this project, I will be exploring various techniques for melody (and perhaps counterpoint) creation in the style of Palestrina.

### Process
I will be using music21 in Python to parse and generate music files. This project currently uses basic Markov chaining to produce melodies based on hundreds of input Palestrina input files.

I will be saving snapshots of different generation techniques by saving different files. Hopefully this will be a good way to go back and explore which methods worked well/contributed to the quality of the generated piece. This way, as my methods of evaluation for generate scores change, I can return to precious methods and test them.

Later in the semester I plan on exploring either counterpoint or different learning algorithms (perhaps some powerful third-party tools rather than my own Markov algorithms).
